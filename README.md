# CS212-PROJECT1
In this project we were asked to read from a .txt file and create a Clock object which will take in hour, minute, second values. Then use that to show a GUI with a grid layout to show an unsorted array of the Clock objects and a sorted array of the Clock object. The sorting is done using Selection Sorting

## What I did:
 - This is a project where we read from a .txt file.
 - Then create a Clock(hours, minute, second) object and storing the read values from that file into the Clock object.
 - Then creating two arrays, one is sorted and the other is unsorted.
 - The sorted array uses Selection Sorting to sort the elements in it.
 - Then display both arrays in a grid layout GUI using JFrame.
 
## What I learned:
 - I learned to create objects in Java.
 - I learned to sort arrays using Selection Sorting method.
 - I learned to create a GUI and then add elements and value to those elements on the GUI
 - This is a JFrame GUI.
